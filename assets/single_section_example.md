## The Future of AI Agents and Their Impact on Work

### Summary

The advent of AI agents is set to revolutionize the future of work by 2025. These agents, capable of taking on increasingly human-like roles, will not only change the way we work but also create new cultural norms, especially in the workplace. With the ability to complete complex tasks, AI agents will move beyond simply finding information to executing tasks autonomously. The collaboration between AI agents and humans will transform the future of work, making it more efficient, innovative, and productive.

1. The third wave of AI, known as agentic AI, will primarily augment human capabilities, with humans taking on roles similar to chiefs of staff who coordinate and manage teams of AI agents.
2. The future of work will require professionals to understand AI capabilities and limitations, learn to delegate effectively to AI agents, and develop new competencies in orchestrating human-AI collaborations.
3. The relationship between humans and robots will change, becoming closely integrated in several aspects of life, displacing some workers while creating opportunities for new jobs in other sectors.
